# Diabetes-Health-Indicators

📘 Project Overview

This project analyzes health indicators to predict whether an individual is likely to have diabetes (1) or not (0).
Using features such as BMI, age, glucose level, blood pressure, physical activity, and other lifestyle factors, the goal is to build an interpretable and reliable classification model that highlights the main drivers of diabetes risk.

🎯 Objectives

Clean and preprocess the raw health data.

Explore and visualize relationships between features and diabetes risk.

Train and evaluate multiple classification models.

Identify the most important predictors and provide actionable insights.

🤖 Modeling Approach

This is a binary classification problem. Typical models tested:

Logistic Regression (baseline, interpretable)

Random Forest Classifier

XGBoost / LightGBM Classifier

Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy (useful if classes balanced)
